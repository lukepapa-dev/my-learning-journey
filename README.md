# My Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome! This repository is where I document my path into **programming, machine learning, and AI development**.  
I’m starting from the ground up and using this space as a **public logbook** of my progress, experiments, and growth.  

---

## 🌱 What You’ll Find Here
- **Learning Notes** → Python exercises, problem-solving, and Git/GitHub practice.  
- **Mini Projects** → small coding experiments to apply new concepts.  
- **AI/ML Exploration** → early steps into data, models, and automation.  
- **Reflections** → documenting challenges, breakthroughs, and lessons learned.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong foundations in Python and machine learning.  
- Get comfortable with GitHub workflows and collaboration.  
- Share my progress publicly for accountability.  
- Transition from learning → building → creating real-world applications.
